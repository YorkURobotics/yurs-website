      <h2>What is Industry Night?</h2>
  </header>
<p>
      Industry Night: Computing and Mechanics is a blended convention-conference style event where the
      organizer, York University Robotics Society, invites Lassonde School of Engineering students, clubs,
      alumni, faculty, and industry partners to come together to showcase recent achievements, products and
      projects, network, recruit, and have dinner together.
      Students are encouraged to dress professionally and be prepared to network with potential employers
      and show off any projects they might have. This is the perfect opportunity to meet with engineers and
      recruiters from industry partners to learn more about their company's career opportunities, and some of
      the technical aspects of their projects, services, and products!
      Industry Partners are encouraged to treat this event as a recruiting event and your standard
      convention/conference to showcase technologies and products. Experience targeted interaction with
      highly motivated students! Explore the opportunities available when you partner
      with student clubs and design teams. Get technical with soon-to-be engineers!
      This event is centred around EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and Mechanical
      Engineering Departments of the Lassonde School of Engineering. Targeting students of these
      departments and the respective related industries.
