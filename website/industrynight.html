  <h2 class="in_text_header">What is Industry Night?</h2>
</header>

<p class="in_text">
  <strong>Industry Night: Computing and Mechanics </strong> is a
  student-organized, convention-conference hybrid event at the Lassonde School
  of Engineering. It is designed to foster meaningful connections between
  industry partners, students, alumni, and faculty. The event provides a
  platform for networking, recruitment, and the exchange of ideas, projects,
  research, products, and technologies. Our goal is to facilitate engaging
  discussions and build valuable relationships, all while enjoying a shared
  dinner. <br /><br /><br />
  <strong>Industry Partners and Researchers </strong> are
  strongly encouraged to not only treat this as a networking event, but
  also an event to show off their products, technologies and research.
  This gives students the opportunity to experience a little bit of what
  it's like attending a conference as they are in turn encouraged to ask a
  lot of questions and to dive into technical conversations! Experience
  targeted interaction with highly motivated students! Explore the
  opportunities available when you partner with student clubs and design
  teams. Get technical with soon-to-be engineers! <br /><br />
  <strong>Students</strong> are encouraged to dress professionally and be
  prepared to network with potential employers and show off any projects they
  might have. This is the perfect opportunity to meet with engineers and
  recruiters from industry partners to learn more about their company's career
  opportunities, and some of the technical aspects of their projects, services,
  and products! <br /><br />
  This event is centred around EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer
  Science) and Mechanical Engineering Departments of the Lassonde School of
  Engineering. Targeting students of these departments and the respective
  related industries.
