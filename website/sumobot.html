      The Sumobot team engineer small, autonomous robots designed to track down and push an opposing robot out of a
      ring. Competing in the annual McMaster Sumobot Competition, the Sumobot Team is a great place to work in a
      close-knit team to build up your skills in all areas of robotics. The team is open to all students, regardless of
      experience and major.

      <h2>Programming With Arduinos!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      To make these little robots think, we need to give their microporcessors instructions to follow. With the power of
      Arudino C, they shall gains the brains to win the competition. Never programmed? Don't worry, our workshops are
      designed to get you started from nothing!

      <h2>Circuits! Circuit of life!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      These little bots are centered around their simple circuit design. We already have a basic circuit laid out for
      you that you can modify to your liking! Want more or different sensors? Another motor for an arm? You can do it!

    <p>
      Once you got your bot spinning its wheels, how do you hold it all together? You'll design your own enclosure using
      CAD! Some of our workshops will be dedicated to learning Fusion 360 and the quirks of 3D printing. Once it's all
      done, we will 3D print the parts for you so you can asseemble your bot.
